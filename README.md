Trying out Giphy Web API

I used the React components from the official Giphy SDK to create this app.

Steps:
 * Follow standard steps to install npm dependencies (npm install etc)
 * To run application, execute command `npm run dev` from within the top level `giphy-search` directory.
 * The web application should be running on `http://localhost:5173/`
 * There is no corresponding server application required for this.
 
 Attached is a screenshot of the app:
